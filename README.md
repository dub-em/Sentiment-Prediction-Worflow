# Election-Campaign-Application

## Phase 2 Imiplementation(Citizens' Voice)
+ This project is the second phase of an intended bigger idea. This phase will focus on executing NLP algorithms and methods to answer the research questions raised in the first phase of the project in a more in-depth way.  

### Problem Statement (Citizens' Voice)
+ There is a significant disconnect between public office holders and the sentiment/complaints of the citizens they preside over, even in cases where the said public office holder or leader is willing to pay attention. This issue has been largely tackled in developed countries, but still remain a major hinderance in undeveloped countries.
+ This problem also makes it difficult for people in power to lead a people-driven development, rather they end up executing policies and project they believe best with little influence from what the citizens think.
+ This problem also leads to generic campaigns, when in reality different states or districts may have different problems to address. A generic campaign might work more in underdeveloped countries, but as these countries start to develop, this generalized approach starts to have diminishing returns.
+ This is but to mention a few, and will be expanded upon as the project gets scaled up.

### Purpose of this Project 
+ This application will enable end-users to answer essential campaign and governance related question, using extracted, wrangled and analyzed data from the social media platform called Twitter. As this project is scaled up, more social platform will be included in the extraction source.
+ The research questions cover four main areas of focus, which is aimed at gaining an insight into the thought, complaints and sentiment of the citizens on certain areas of government or general topics, as well as their views and sentiments on various public office holders.
+ The four main areas are;
    - General Trends
    - Citizens' Sentiment
    - Complaint Areas
    - Politicians' Reputation
